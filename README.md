# Selective Spectral-Spatial Aggregation Transformer for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Classification (IEEE GRSL)

## Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer have achieved excellent classification performances in HSI and LiDAR land cover classification. However, for complex land covers, effectively characterizing the contextual information and spectral-spatial interaction features of HSI and LiDAR is crucial for improving classification accuracy. Motivated by this, this paper is dedicated to selective convolutional kernel mechanisms and spectral-spatial interactive transformer feature learning style, proposing a selective spectral-spatial aggregation transformer network, named S2ATNet. A convolution feature selected module (CFSM), which can dynamically capture its contextual features of various land covers, is firstly utilized into both of HSI and LiDAR branches. Afterwards, a cascaded spatial-spectral learning and interactive fusion block (CSLIF) is designed for acquiring the non-local spatial-spectral characteristics in an interactive feature learning style. The learned features are fed into max-average classification head (\rewrite{MACH}) to obtain the final classification results. The effectiveness of the proposed S2ATNet is validated on two publicly available datasets.
